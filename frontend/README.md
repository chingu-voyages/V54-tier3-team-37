## <a id="about-project"></a>‚ÑπÔ∏è About Project

Prompto is the frontend application designed to be the user interface for interacting with the Prompto backend. Its primary goal is to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users to generate high-quality prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) based on the Pentagram framework. The frontend focuses on presenting a clean form for structured input, displaying generated results, and managing prompt history, ensuring users can efficiently create and organize their interactions with AI models.

Prompto is built with **React 19** and **TypeScript**, styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first approach. It utilizes **React Router v6** for navigation and **Redux Toolkit** for state management, particularly for handling authentication status and managing the prompt generation/history data fetched from the backend. The application is built to be responsive and user-friendly, complementing the backend's powerful prompt generation capabilities. It leverages **Vite** as its build tool for a fast development experience.

## <a id="how-it-works"></a>üîß How it works

- The application is a Single Page Application (SPA) powered by React and React Router for navigation.
- Authentication state (`isLoggedIn`, `user`, `isLoading`) is managed globally using Redux Toolkit.
- The `AuthWrapper` component fetches the current user on application load to determine the initial authentication state.
- `PrivateRoute` components protect routes that require authentication, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page (`/auth`) while preserving the intended destination in the navigation state.
- The homepage (`/`) showcases the application's value proposition with a "Get Started" button that navigates to `/auth` or `/dashboard` based on the user's login status.
- The `/auth` page provides the interface for users to authenticate via the backend's OAuth flow (Google/GitHub). Upon successful login, the user is redirected back to the page they originally intended to visit or to the dashboard (`/dashboard`) if they navigated directly to `/auth`.
- The `/dashboard` route acts as a layout container for authenticated features, including the Prompt Generation and Prompt History pages. Navigating directly to `/dashboard` redirects to `/dashboard/history`.
- The Prompt Generation page (`/dashboard/generate`) uses React Hook Form with Zod validation for structured input based on the Pentagram format.
- Speech-to-Text input (Proof-of-Concept) is integrated using the Web Speech API via the `SpeechInputButton` component, allowing users to dictate into form fields directly within the browser.
- The Prompt History page (`/dashboard/history`) fetches the user's saved prompts from the backend and displays them in an expandable list. Each prompt includes details, rating, copy, edit, and delete options.
- State updates for prompt history (fetching, deleting, rating) are handled via Redux Toolkit async thunks that interact with the backend API using the native `fetch` API.
- Visual feedback for asynchronous operations (loading, errors) and user actions (copying, saving rating) is provided using Sonner toasts.
- Styling is handled using Tailwind CSS, often applied via reusable components from `shadcn/ui`.
